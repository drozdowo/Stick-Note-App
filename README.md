# Sticky Note App
A small application built using the following libraries:
 - Electron
 - MongoDB
 - Socket-io
 - React

 The main purpose of this application was to be a small replacement for e-mail, allowing people to quickly communicate
 small messages to different users, and have it appear on their screen in the form of a sticky note.

 Below is the electron quick start guide on how to get this running:

# electron-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see an Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
